# GitHub API

This is a client app that can view GitHub users and show their repositories using GitHub REST API. This is a project that will be **updating daily** until **July 25, 2025**

## Notes

Upon cloning or downloading, please follow the steps below:

1. open terminal and run `pod update`

2. open `.xcworkspace` file

Please take note that web view can be closed by dragging from top to bottom

## Highlights

1. In this project, I used **MVC framework** making it more manageable and maintainability 
2. I used storyboard references as a way to separate each module. Preventing conflicts specially on a team of developers working on different modules. 
3. Adding common functions on `Extensions` folder. You will find here functions that are widely used on a common class (e.g. `String` & `UIImage`)

## Updating

As mentioned above, I will be updating this project until the said date comes. This is to code every features that I found interesting or better UI/UX wise
